</header>
<article>
**Last updated: October 9, 2012**

By using the Stripe Connect API you agree to be bound by both the Stripe Terms of Service (**"ToS"**) and this Addendum.

1.  ## General

    Stripe Connect is a service designed to make it easier for the businesses that use your website or application (**"Your Merchant(s)"**) to establish a Stripe account and use Stripe’s payment processing services with Your service.

2.  ## Using the Stripe Connect API

    Stripe will make available certain application programming interfaces (**"Stripe Connect API"**), which will enable the provisioning and management of Your Merchant accounts, as more fully described in the documentation available at <https://stripe.com/docs> (collectively, with this Addendum and any code of conduct made available by Stripe from time to time, the **"Connect Documentation"**).  You will use the Stripe Connect API solely in accordance with the Connect Documentation.

3.  ## Relationship with Your Merchants

    a. You may refer Your Merchants to Stripe, but you are not a reseller or distributor of Stripe’s services.  Stripe will have a direct contractual relationship with each of Your Merchants to which we provide services, and Stripe will be solely responsible for establishing the terms and conditions under which we provides our services to Your Merchants.

    b. Stripe will have sole discretion regarding whether or not to provide Stripe services to any of Your Merchants.  Stripe reserves the right to suspend or terminate provision of Stripe services to any of Your Merchants at any time for any reason including, for example, violation of the ToS, applicable card network rules, or the requirements of Stripe’s banking or processing service providers.

4.  ## Relationship with You

    a. You and Stripe are independent contractors, and this Addendum does not create any partnership, agency or employment relationship between us.

    b. Stripe may periodically provide you information about the pricing and other material terms under which we provide Stripe service to Your Merchants.  You will accurately reflect such information on your website or in your application if you make reference to Stripe, but you will not make any other representations regarding the Stripe services, and you will not make any warranty, covenant or other binding commitment on behalf of Stripe.

5.  ## Data Protection; Privacy

    You will have a privacy policy that tells Your Merchants what data obtained using Stripe Connect (“**Stripe Connect Data**”) that you are going to use and how you will use, display or transfer that data. You will include a prominent link to your privacy policy in any website or application that you link to Stripe Connect. You will only use Stripe Connect Data in the context of Your Merchant’s experience on your application. You will obtain explicit consent from Your Merchant before using any Stripe Connect Data for any purpose other than displaying it back to the user within your application. You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect Stripe Connect Data from unauthorized use or disclosure.

5.  ## Logo Usage; License

    Stripe will develop and host a co-branded account page (**"Co-Branded Page"**) using the logo(s) that you provide when registering for your Stripe Connect account (**"Provided Logo"**). Stripe will present the Co-Branded Page to Your Merchants that we identify as navigating from your service to a Stripe account.  You grant Stripe a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use the Provided Logo on the Co-Branded Page during the Term (as defined below).

6.  ## Limitations on Use of Stripe Connect API

    You will:

    a.  use the Stripe Connect API and any information obtained from Your  Merchant’s Stripe account solely for the purposes for which you have been authorized by such Merchant;

    b.  not use the Stripe Connect API to access any information or take any action for which your authorization has been withdrawn by Your Merchant;

    c.  not use the Stripe Connect API for any fraudulent, unlawful or abusive purposes or in any manner intended to harm Stripe, any of Your Merchants or any third party;

    d.  not circumvent Stripe’s intended limitations for any feature of the Stripe Connect API;

    e.  not use the Stripe Connect API in any manner inconsistent with the Connect Documentation.

7.  ## Term and Termination

    The term of this Addendum (**"Term"**) will commence upon your first use of the Stripe Connect API and will continue until either you or Stripe terminates it upon notice to the other.  Upon termination, (a) Stripe will cease all use of the Provided Logo, and (b) you will cease all use of the Stripe Connect API.  Except for foregoing, the terms of this Addendum will survive any termination.

8.  ## Representations and Warranties

    You represent and warrant to Stripe that you have obtained proper authorization for each action you take, and for any information you access, on behalf of Your Merchant through or in connection with the Stripe Connect API.

9.  ## Indemnification

    In addition to the obligations arising under the ToS, you will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Stripe, its banking institutions, and the subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees of each of the foregoing, from and against any third party claim arising from or in any way related to: (a) your misuse of the Stripe Connect APIs; (b) your violation of this Addendum; or (c) any third party's misuse of the Stripe Connect APIs or actions that would constitute a violation of these terms provided that you enabled such third party to access the Stripe Connect APIs or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent such third party from accessing the Stripe Connect APIs.

10. ## Disclaimer

    STRIPE MAKES THE STRIPE APPS API AVAILABLE TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY.  USE OF THE STRIPE APPS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.   STRIPE WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY AMOUNT, WHETHER AS INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF THE STRIPE APPS API, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU ADVISED US OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  For clarity, all reference to the "Service" in the ToS shall be deemed to include the Stripe Connect API.

11. ## Intellectual Property

    As between the parties, (a) you will own all right, title and interest, including all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, in and to the your website, service and Provided Logo, and (b) Stripe will own all right, title and interest, including all copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, in and to the Stripe service, the Stripe Connect API and the Stripe Marks.  Except as expressly set forth herein, no license, ownership or other interest is transferred under this Agreement.  The parties do not intend that any joint development will occur under or in connection with this Agreement.
